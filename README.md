# What is dojoJS

An simple online tool for unit testing and for coding dojos with Javascript language.

# It seems really simple. Is that the best you can do?

No. It is the best I could do so far. Some good people have given me good ideas on how to improve the tool, which I have already started to work at.
The first advice I have taken was to put it on Github, so anyone interested in help me will be my guest!

# What other info it can be said about the tool? 

At the moment, this is it! The tool seems to be working fine the way it is. I need as many feedback and suggestions as I can catch.
